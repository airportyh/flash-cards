# CSS Selector

A CSS selector is the part of a CSS rule that specifies what elements in an HTML
document are to be matched by the rule. Two types of CSS selectors include

* [ID Selector](#ID-Selector): `#the-id`
* [Class Selector](#Class-Selector): `#the-class`

In the following example, the CSS selector (specifically, an ID selector) has been highlighted:

<pre>
<span class="highlight">#the-id</span> {
  color: red;
}
</pre>
