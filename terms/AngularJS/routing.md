# Routing

In the context of AngularJS, routing is the process of dispatching the control of the page to a specific [controller](#/AngularJS/controller) based on the [fragment identifier](#/HTML/fragment_identifier), or the part of the URL after the `#` character.

Routing in AngularJS is most commonly done with the [ng-route module](#/AngularJS/ng-route), which is an AngularJS plugin you need to download separately into your project and link into your HTML page.
