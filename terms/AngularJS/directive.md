# Directive

An AngularJS directive is a special attribute on a DOM element or a special tag name on a DOM element that triggers a special behavior. Example directives are:

* [ng-app](#AngularJS/ng-app)
* [ng-controller](#AngularJS/ng-controller)
* [ng-click](#AngularJS/ng-click)
* [ng-show](#AngularJS/ng-show)
* [ng-repeat](#AngularJS/ng-repeat)
* [ng-disabled](#AngularJS/ng-disabled)
* [ng-model](#AngularJS/ng-model)

It is possible to create [custom directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive), which is a good way to reuse common component code.
