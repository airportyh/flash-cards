# Heading Element

A heading [element](#HTML/element) provides a description of the content that comes after it.

In HTML5, there are six levels of document headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. `<h1>` is the most important heading and is typically the first heading used on a page. `<h6>` is the least important heading and would be included on the page after more the important headings.
