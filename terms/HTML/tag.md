# Tag

A tag in HTML starts with a `<`, has a string of characters in the middle, and ends with a `>`. There are open tags and end tags. An open tag looks like this:

```
<h1>
```

An end tag has an extra `/` before the beginning `<` and looks like this:

```
</h1>
```

A start tag is most often closed with an end tag, like so:

```
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
```

This makes an [element](#HTML/element). However, some tags are self closing, and do not require a closing tag. One example is the `<br>` tag for line breaks. Another is the `<input>` tag:

```
<input type="text" name="username">
```
