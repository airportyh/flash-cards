# Semantic Element

Semantic elements are HTML elements that contain information about the purpose and content of the element. In other words, you should be able to look at the HTML tag and guess what the tag means.

Examples of semantic elements include `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<nav>`. It should be obvious that `<header>` contains a header, `<footer>` contains a footer, `<section>` contains a section, and `<nav>` contains a navigation menu.

On the other hand, `<div>` is *not* a semantic element, because it is not obvious what "div" means. `<div>` elements are merely containers than can hold a wide range of content, from text to other elements such as `<img>` or `<button>`.

`<span>` is also *not* semantic, because "span" does not contain any information about what the element contains.
