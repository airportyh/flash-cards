# `style` attribute

The style [attribute](#HTML/attribute) modifies the style of an HTML [element](#HTML/element).

A style attribute requires a CSS declaration (or declarations) inside the quotation marks. For example,

<pre>
&lt;div <span class="highlight">style="max-width: 680px;"</span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

In this case, `max-width` is a CSS property, and `680px` is the value of that property. Also note that CSS declarations are ended by a semicolon.

**Note:** `<style>` is also an HTML element that allows CSS code to be embedded within an HTML document.
